### Elasticity

Elasticity is the property of a material that 
enables it to return to its original shape 
and size after being subjected to a force. 
Elasticity plays a crucial role in many 
engineering applications.

The Theory of Elasticity is a branch of solid 
mechanics that deals with the behaviour of 
elastic materials.  The Theory of Elasticity 
describes the relationships between 
displacement, strain, and stress fields in 
elastic materials.
