### Strain

Strain is defined as the ratio of the change
in length of the material to the original
length of the material.  It is expressed as
a percentage or a decimal value, and is
denoted using the symbol "Îµ".  Strain is a
dimensionless quantity, meaning that it has
no units.

There are several types of strain, including
axial strain, shear strain, and volumetric
strain.  Axial strain refers to the change
in length of an object that is subjected to
an applied force or load, while shear strain
refers to the change in shape of an object
due to twisting or shearing forces. 
Volumetric strain, on the other hand, refers
to the change in volume of an object in
response to a load or force.

Strain is an important parameter in the
study of material behaviour, and is used to
describe the elastic and plastic deformation
of materials.
