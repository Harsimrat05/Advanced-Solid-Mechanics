### Strain field

The strain field is a vector field that 
describes the distribution of strain within a 
material. It is a fundamental parameter in 
the study of material behaviour, and is used 
to describe the elastic and plastic 
deformation of materials. The strain field 
can be calculated using a number of different 
methods, including finite element analysis.

It is used in a wide range of applications, 
from materials science and engineering to 
geology and seismology.
