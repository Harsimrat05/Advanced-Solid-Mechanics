### Stress field

Stress refers to the internal force per unit area acting in a material in response to an external load or force. It is a tensor quantity, and is denoted using the symbol "Ïƒ". 

The stress field is an important parameter in the study of material behaviour, and is used to describe the elastic and plastic deformation of materials. The stress field can be calculated using a number of different methods, including finite element analysis, which involves dividing a material into smaller elements and solving for the stress in each element.
